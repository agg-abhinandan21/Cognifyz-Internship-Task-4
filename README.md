💼 Power BI Internship 

Task-4: Investment Duration & Frequency Analysis 📊

As part of my Power BI Internship with Cognifyz Technologies, I worked on creating an interactive dashboard to analyze investment avenues, duration preferences, and monitoring frequency.

🔍 Key Highlights of the Dashboard:

Investment Avenues Covered: Equity, Fixed Deposits, Mutual Funds, Public Provident Fund.

Dynamic Filtering: Visuals update instantly when a specific investment type is selected.

Duration Insights: Most investments fall under 3-5 years and 1-3 years categories.

Monitoring Patterns: Majority of investors prefer Monthly monitoring, followed by Weekly and Daily.

User-Friendly Design: Sleek dark theme with easy-to-read KPIs and bar charts for better decision-making.

🛠 Tools Used:

Microsoft Power BI

Data Cleaning & Transformation in Power Query

Interactive Slicers & Cards for better visualization

This dashboard not only presents the current investment patterns but also helps in identifying trends for better financial planning strategies.

📈 Learning Outcome: Strengthened my skills in data visualization, DAX functions, and interactive dashboard design.
